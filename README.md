# Financial Sentiment Forecast

[![CI Status](https://github.com/beckhamberhanu/Financial-News-Analysis/actions/workflows/python-app.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/beckhamberhanu/Financial-News-Analysis/actions/workflows/python-app.yml)

FinancialSentimentForecast explores the relationship between financial news sentiment and stock market trends. By combining natural language processing (NLP) with technical analysis, the project aims to provide actionable insights that can inform predictive stock market modeling.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Classify financial news headlines as positive, negative, or neutral using NLP.
- **Stock Analysis**: Compute technical indicators (Moving Averages, RSI, MACD) to capture price dynamics.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Examine statistical relationships between sentiment scores and subsequent price moves.
- **Visualization**: Produce intuitive charts to surface patterns and trends in markets and news.

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Python**: 3.12+
- **Libraries**: Pandas, TextBlob, TA-Lib, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- **CI**: GitHub Actions (`python-app.yml`) for automated checks

> Note: TA-Lib may require system-level dependencies. On Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install -y ta-lib` (or build from source) before `pip` installation.

## 🔧 Getting Started

### 1) Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/beckhamberhanu/Financial-News-Analysis.git
cd Financial-News-Analysis
```

### 2) Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)

```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

### 3) Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.text
```

If TA-Lib fails to install via `pip`, install system TA-Lib first, then retry the `pip` command.

---

## 📊 Usage

- **Explore notebooks**: Open the Jupyter notebooks in `notebooks/` to see the analysis pipeline end-to-end (sentiment scoring, indicator computation, correlation studies, and visualization).

```bash
jupyter lab  # or: jupyter notebook
```

- **Figures**: Exported plots can be saved into `figs/` if desired.

> Future scripts in `scripts/` and modules in `src/` can encapsulate reusable data pipelines and models.
