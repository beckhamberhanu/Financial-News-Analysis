Driven by a passion for leveraging technology to solve real-world problems and impact lives, I've evolved from system engineer to project manager, leading high-impact initiatives that modernize systems and pave the way for new technologies.

My career aspirations focus on two areas: making impactful research contributions to the scholarly community and spearheading technology-driven business projects that serve vulnerable populations, a cause close to my heart.

Project management excites me because it allows me to combine my technical expertise with leadership skills to drive change and benefit diverse communities. I'm proficient in Agile methodologies, stakeholder management, and strategic alignment, and I'm always eager to learn new technologies and approaches.
